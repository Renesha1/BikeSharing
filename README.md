# BikeSharing
## Purpose of Analysis
  The purpose of this analysis is to show the tripduration as a datetime datatype so the number of males and females bike trips, checkouts and rides can be analyzed weekly. Tableau was used to show a clear visualization for the general public. This data assisted with convincing investors that a bike-sharing program in the local area  will be a solid business proposal.

## Summary
  `Concluding Results`
  -More males than females checked out bikes

  -During Weekdays more people checked out bikes between the hours 7am-9am and 3pm-8pm
  -On the weekends more people checkout out bikes during the hours 9am-7pm
  -Even though there are more people that ride the bikes during the week the weekend has the most steady time frame of people checking out bikes.(The duration is greater)
  
 `Suggestions`
 - Market to female population
 - To get a more accurate set of data create a way to document everyone's gender that checks out a bike
